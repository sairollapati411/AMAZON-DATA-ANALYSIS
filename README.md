# AMAZON-DATA-ANALYSIS
This project involved analyzing Amazon datasets to uncover insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. Key tasks included cleaning and preprocessing data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizing patterns such as top-selling products, customer sentiment from reviews, and seasonal sales trends. 

Problem Definition: Identified key business questions, such as understanding customer purchasing behavior, analyzing product performance, or identifying trends in reviews and ratings.

Data Collection: Gathered data from Amazon datasets, including product listings, customer reviews, sales data, and other relevant information.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handled missing or inconsistent data.
Performed data transformations like normalizing, aggregating, and encoding categorical variables.
Ensured the dataset was ready for analysis by applying techniques such as outlier detection and removal.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed sales patterns, customer demographics, and product popularity.
Used visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Power BI to present key trends and insights.

Text Analysis (if applicable): Conducted sentiment analysis on customer reviews using NLP tools like NLTK or SpaCy to understand customer satisfaction and feedback.

Predictive Modeling: Built predictive models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or recommendation systems) to forecast sales or recommend products based on customer behavior.

Performance Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE, ensuring actionable results.

Reporting: Delivered a comprehensive report or dashboard summarizing findings and providing recommendations to optimize business strategies, such as improving product listings, targeting specific customer segments, or adjusting inventory levels
